# DONT WORK APP!!


# DEControl 🔻

A test prototype to shut down your PC remotely from Android.  
No active development, no guarantees — just an experiment and idea dump.

## ✅ Current Functionality
- 📴 Shut down your Windows PC over local network.

That's it.

## 📦 How it works
- Python (Flask) server runs on your PC.
- Android app sends a GET request like `http://your_pc_ip:5000/shutdown`.

## 📡 Requirements
- Phone and PC in same Wi-Fi.
- Python installed with Flask.
- Windows OS.

## 🔐 Warning
This is **not secure** by default. No authentication.  
Don't expose it to the internet.

## 🚧 Status
**Test prototype only.**  
Might continue, might not. Depends on vibe.

## ⚠️ License
MIT. Use if you want. I don’t care.
